332. Reconstruct Itinerary

- from, to
- all depart from jfk
- return smallest lexicographical ordering
- must use all tickets?

- basic graph puzzle?
- just do dfs? prioritize smaller lexicographical airport?
- greedy? just take smallest lexicographical from each airport?
    - could run into dead end without hitting all others
    - so do dfs and pick lowest lexical, but go in order
